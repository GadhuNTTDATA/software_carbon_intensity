# Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification

A specification that descibes how to calcualte a carbon intensity for software applications. 

Created and managed by the [Standards Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards_wg) in the [greensoftware.foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).


## Project Scope
This document, the Software Carbon Intensity technical specification, describes how to calculate the carbon intensity of a software application. It describes the methodology of calculating the total carbon emissions and the selection criteria to turn the total into a rate that can be used to achieve real-wold, physical emissions reductions, also known as abatement.

Electricity has a carbon intensity depending on where and when it is consumed. An intensity is a rate. It has a numerator and a denominator. A rate provides you with helpful information when considering the growth of a software product. This specification describes the carbon intensity of a software application or service.

## Getting Started
- The main specification document is [here](/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md) please review.
- The `dev` branch cotains the current version that is being worked on and the `main` branch contains the latest published version.
- Check the issues tab for actove and closed converations regarding the spec.
- The correct method is to raise an issue and discuss in the issues tab above, once some form of agreement has been reached then raise a pull request to update the specification. Pull requests are reviewed and merged during Standards Working Group meetings.
- Only chairs of the Standards Working Group can merge pull requests.
